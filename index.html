                            <div class="hover-text"> The study aims to address the challenges of automatic melanoma diagnosis by improving hair segmentation from skin lesions using deep learning (DL) models. This process is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of melanoma detection, as hair artifacts can obscure lesion areas. The research evaluates ten DL methods for hair segmentation, trained with different weight configurations and encoder backbones on a public dermoscopic dataset.
                                The performance of these models is assessed using various metrics and computational complexity analyses. Additionally, statistical significance tests validate the differences in model performance, ensuring that improvements are not due to random variations. The findings reveal that the pretrained UNet++ model with ResNet-50 encoder is the most accurate for hair segmentation. For low-resource environments, pretrained PSPNet or FPN with ResNet-18 encoder are recommended, while pretrained UNet++ or LinkNet with ResNet-18 encoder offer a balance between performance and computational efficiency.</div>

                            <div class="hover-text">The study introduces the Adaptive BERT-CNN model to improve the analysis of long text reviews for recommender systems. Traditional models like BERT struggle with long texts, so the proposed model combines BERT with CNN using a chunking technique that segments long reviews into smaller parts while preserving context. This allows CNNs to capture patterns across these chunks, enhancing sentiment analysis and recommendations. The model was tested on various datasets and achieved a high accuracy of 99.76%, significantly outperforming baseline models like BERT and CNN, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling long reviews and understanding user sentiments.</div>

                           <div class="hover-text">Sentiment analysis is one of the important aspects of discovering user opinions and enhancing the quality of products like mobile applications. This study assesses the effectiveness of six prominent Natural Language Processing (NLP) models—BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)—in classifying sentiments from a large dataset of Google Play Store reviews. We collected 73,483 reviews from 45 apps, preprocessed the data, and employed two labeling methods: a pre-trained DistilBERT model and K-means clustering. Our results compare transformer-based models, BERT and XLNet, with traditional recurrent models for sentiment analysis of mobile application reviews. The results show that transformer-based models achieve higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores with DistilBERT pre-trained model labeling. However, no single model strikes a balance between recall and precision using K-means clustering labels. These findings suggest that the choice of labeling method, in addition to the use of advanced transformer models and embeddings, significantly affects model performance.</div>

                            <div class="hover-text">Schizophrenia (SZ) is a challenging mental disorder, requiring accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Early diagnosis of schizophrenia can facilitate a normal life for patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data contains valuable insights into brain network connectivity, enabling the detection of abnormalities associated with schizophrenia. Hence, this study proposes a methodology employing a deep learning-based model utilizing deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) with an Attention mechanism to classify schizophrenia patients. In this research, each EEG signal undergoes decomposition with Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to extract relevant features that capture the underlying neurophysiological characteristics of brain activity. These features are then utilized to distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy individuals using the proposed method, which is evaluated on an EEG dataset comprising 45 schizophrenic patients and 39 healthy subjects. To provide a comparison, various deep learning models like ResNet-50,CNN and DenseNet Model are applied. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms all other methods tested.</div>

Data analysis has exhibited a strong correlation between several financial and personal factors of a client and the likelihood of said client complying with their respective bank's credit policies. In this paper, we propose the use of the PARAFAC tensor factorization method to predict and grant credit cards to applicants based on the customers' activity history. We used six financial and personal factors and constructed a tensor by reducing them into three factors. We predicted the resulting factors through the use of alternating least squares algorithm with an emphasis on error minimization and finally re-constructed the original tensor.</div>

                                creating daily meal plans based on nutrition-focused information. The framework features
                                a filtered daily meal plan using a multi-criteria decision tree, to exclude unsuitable foods
                                based on the user's proper nutritional need. It also provides grocery suggestions, which tell
                                users what kinds of foods they should have and shouldn't, as well as reminders about the
                                food items that are running low. The benefit of this recommender system is that users may
                                find their daily meal plans by altering the quantity of macronutrients they need each day.
                                The recommendation algorithm looks over all of the meal plans, determines which is ideal
                                based on the users' calorie intake, modifies the meal plans appropriately, and suggests
                                groceries to fit the suggested meal plans.</p>

                            <p class="hover-text">This study focused on using EEG signals to accurately diagnose schizophrenia through a deep learning-based model. It proposes employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an Attention mechanism for classification. EEG signals are first decomposed using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to extract features that reflect brain activity. These features are then used to differentiate between 45 schizophrenia patients and 39 healthy individuals. The proposed model is compared against various machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree) and deep learning models (ResNet-50, DenseNet). Results show that the proposed method outperforms all other tested models.</p>
